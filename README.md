So far, theses following matrix operations are implemented: 

- Sum of two matrix
- Subtration of two matrix
- Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar element
- Multiplication between two matrix
- Division of a matrix by a scalar element

## Future implementations:
- Transpose of a matrix
- Desktop GUI
