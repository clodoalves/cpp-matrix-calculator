Hey there!

This is a simple study repo with some matrix arithmetic operations using C++

So far, theses following matrix operations are implemented: 

- Sum of two matrix
- Subtration of two matrix
- Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar element
- Multiplication between two matrix
- Division of a matrix by a scalar element

## Future steps:
- Implementation of the transpose matrix
- Implementation of a desktop GUI
- Implementation of unit tests
